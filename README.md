<center>State-space Stock Assessment with population eXchange</center>
---

Development of state-space stock assessment models for application to open systems where the stock under analysis is connected to a wider population. The preliminary applications is the yellowfin tuna population which supports fisheries in the Main Hawaiian Islands. The MHI population is connected to a larger tuna population for which stock assessments are available. The estimated population size in areas surrounding the MHI used to "force" the population dynamics.
