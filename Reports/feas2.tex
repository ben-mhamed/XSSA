\begin{abstract}
Single population models with simplified model structure
were developed to test the feasibility of developing a stock
assessment model for the Main Hawaiian Islands yellowfin tuna fishery.
These models are capable of
estimating critical reference points such as maximum sustainable
yield (MSY) and fishing mortality at MSY. 
Biomass trends between 1952 and 2012 estimated by using different
model configurations differ in general level, but are
qualitatively consistent across models. All models estimate a period of high
biomass between 1970 and 1990, 
including periods where the biomass exceeds the
equilibrium biomass or ``carrying capacity''. 
These models are
promising starting points for development of a full-featured stock
assessment model.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}
A previous evaluation of the feasibility of developing a
stock assessment model for the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) yellowfin
tuna (YFT)
fishery concluded that such a model is feasible, but that estimation of
fishery management reference points is difficult (Sibert, 2015).
The ambiguity of this
conclusion is unsatisfying, and further research was undertaken to
develop more practical alternative models. 
The 2015 model represented
the dynamics of two coupled tuna populations with immigration,
emigration, and fishing and required estimation of approximately 15
parameters. Here I report results of evaluating single
population models with simplified dynamics and fewer parameters.

\section{Methods}
%Model feasibility depends equally on the model and on whether the
%available data contain sufficient information to estimate model
%parameters.  Evaluation of feasibility challenges both the model and
%the available data.

The data used in this analysis are the annual catch data from
five gear types fishing within 200 nm of the Main Hawaiian Islands
(Sibert, 2015).

The basic model is a state-space implementation of the
Schaefer biomass dynamics model (Schaefer, 1954).
The principle model assumptions are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The dynamics of the population of YFT in the MHI follows a
simple Schaefer model.
\item Fishing mortality is represented by a random walk (Nielsen and
Berg, 2014).
\item The local dynamics are ``forced'' by assuming that the local
abundance is approximately proportional to some ``index'' population.
\end{enumerate}

The basic model was implemented with two different parameter
substitutions in an attempt to find parameter combinations that are
more reliably estimated. Indexing was implemented flexibly to
demonstrate the effects of omitting the index altogether.

Model estimates of yellowfin biomass by \MFCL\ (MFCL)
from the most recent \WCPFC\ stock assessment (Davies et al, 2014) provide
a convenient choice of biomass indices. The MHI straddle the
boundary between MFCL regions 2 and 4. Region 2 is arguably more similar
ecologically to the MHI than the more equatorial region 4. The
YFT population
in region 4 is much larger and exhibits a greater level of depletion than the
population in region 2. Estimated biomass trends from MFCL region 2
were used as the abundance index for most model feasibility evaluations.

Complete details of model structure are presented in Appendix~\ref{sec:models}.

Fitting results are summarized in Table~\ref{tag:ests4}.
Both the indexed and non-indexed configurations of the $\MSYFmsy$
parameterization
appear to converge to a meaningful solution with $|G|_{max}<0.01$
whereas the  $\Bd$ parameterizations appear not to have converged. 
Non-indexed models can be considered ``nested'' within indexed
models with the parameter $Q$ constrained to be zero. A likelihood
ratio test is therefore appropriate to test the effect of including
the abundance index in converged $\MSYFmsy$ models. 
The change in negative log likelihood
from -237.238 to -247.175 with one degree of freedom is a statistically
significant change with $P<0.005$.

Estimated biomass trends for the four models are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:estbiomass}.
All four models, including the non-indexed models, predict a large
decrease in biomass between 1975 and 2000. The estimated biomass
decrease mimics the MFCL region 2 biomass trend in the
indexed models, and the indexed models amplify the decrease. The
predicted biomass in the both $\MSYFmsy$ models
and the indexed $\Bd$ model exceeds the equilibrium biomass in the 1970s.
\pagebreak

There is an approximate five-fold difference in estimated population size
between the indexed and non-indexed $\MSYFmsy$ models.
The indexed model estimates a larger and slower growing stock than the
non-indexed model as indicated by estimated values of $r$ and $K$.

Table~\ref{tag:ests4NOprior} summarizes the effects of omitting the
Bayesian prior on the growth rate parameter, $r$. Only one model
configuration, $\MSYFmsy$, converged to a solution with
$|G|_{max}<0.01$. The negative
log likelihood is slightly higher than the same model configuration
using the default prior, suggesting poorer agreement to the data. The
estimated population dynamics indicates a larger and slower growing
population.

\section{Discussion}
The consistent predictions of high biomass in the 1970s followed by a
persistent decrease in biomass through 2000 in the non-indexed models
is evidence that the catch data provide information on
the relative abundance of YFT in the MHI. The dependency of absolute
biomass estimates on an abundance index is characteristic of
production models \help{(references)} and is cause for caution
in drawing fishery management conclusions from these tentative results.

\end{figure}

The choice of index populations makes a large difference in fishery management
conclusions. Figure~\ref{fig:estr4} shows the biomass trend and
production curve for the MHI population indexed to the MFCL region 4
biomass estimates. This choice of index would lead to completely
different fishery management conclusions.
An alternative to selecting MFCL region
biomass estimates as population indexes would be to use
biomass estimates and predictions from the \SD\ model (Senina et al,
2008) as an index of MHI biomass.

Using the output of one model in another model is sometimes known as
``off-line'' coupling, and is used in \SD\ to couple
ecosystem models to tuna population dynamics
This approach is also sometimes disdained as ``piecemeal''
modeling because the variance structure is not usually propagated from
one model to the next. Such propagation may be possible but was not
examined.

Both \MFCL\ and \SD\ predict age and size structure of tuna stocks.
There are some size data for the MHI YFT landings that could be
incorporated into an age-structured model. No work was undertaken to
develop age-structured models.

The use of a random walk to represent fishing mortality ($F$) is a
unique feature of the model presented here.
This approach avoids the problem
of attempting to contrive an objective measure of fishing effort
along with a time-varying catchability coefficient
on which some estimate of $F$ could be based. The random walk provides
a convenient measure of $F$ that enables the logistic model
to estimate population dynamics parameters from catch data alone.

The imposition of Bayesian priors on Schaefer model growth parameters
is often considered essential (\help{references}). 
Both the $\MSYFmsy$ and $\Bd$
parameterizations avoid the problem of estimating $K$ and $r$
simultaneously. The use of a prior on $r$ would appear to offer no
benefit to the $\MSYFmsy$ models, but seems to assist the $\Bd$
models. The great disadvantages of priors are the difficulty of finding
suitable values and the unwanted risk of introducing bias
into the resulting estimates.

The recreational catch of yellowfin tuna in the MHI is thought to be
quite large, approximately the same order of magnitude as the
commercial catch \help{references}.
The lack of readily available accurate estimates of the recreational
catch of YFT makes development of a credible assessment model very
difficult. No attempts were make to evaluate the effects of this
deficiency on estimated model parameters.

\section{Conclusions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Yellowfin catch data from fleets operating in the Main Hawaiian
Islands waters are sufficiently informative to estimate relative
biomass trends.
\item An index of abundance is required to estimate absolute biomass,
but absolute estimates are sensitive to the choice of index
population.
\item Representing trends in fishing mortality as a random walk is a
convenient and effective approach to accounting for the removal of
biomass from the fish population.
\item Bayesian prior on $r$ are difficult to assign and probably not required.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Model development}
\label{sec:models}
State-space models separate variability in the biological
processes in the system (transition model)
from errors in observing features of interest
in the system (observation model).

{\bf Transition Model $T(\alpha_{t-1})$.}
The general form of the transition model is
\begin{equation}
\alpha_t=T(\alpha_{t-1}) + \eta_t
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_t$ is the state at time $t$ and 
the function $T$ embodies the dynamics mediating the
development of the state at time $t$ from the state at the previous
time with random process error, $\eta_t$.

Stock dynamics follow the classic Schaefer differential equation:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:ischaefer}
\frac{dN}{dt} = rN(1-\frac{N}{K}) - FN
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the biomass of YFT in the MHI, 
$r$ is the logistic growth rate per year,
$K$ is the asymptotic biomass, and
$F$ is the total fishing mortality per year in the MHI.

The state space transition equation for the single population model is
developed by solving \ref{eqn:ischaefer} analytically from one time to
the next (see Appendix \ref{sec:schaefer}).
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:intschaeferA}
N_t = \frac{K(r-\bar{F}_t)}{\frac{K(r-\bar{F}_t)}{N_{t-\Delta t}}e^{-\Delta
t(r-\bar{F}_t)}-re^{-\Delta t(r-\bar{F}_t)} -r} \cdot e^{\eta_t};
\quad \eta_t\sim N(0,\sigma^2_N)
\end{equation}
where 
$\bar{F}_t$ is the total fishing mortality, i. e.,
$$
\bar{F}_t =\sum_{g=1}^n F_{g,t-\Delta t}.
$$
and $\eta_t \sim N(0,\sigma_N)$ is a process error expressing
variability in population dynamics.

Fishing mortality is treated as a random walk.
The logarithm of fishing mortality is assumed to
follow a random walk with normal increments, as suggested by Berg and
Nielsen (2014).
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:Fwalk}
\log F_{g,t} = \log F_{g,t-1} + \xi_t;\quad \xi_t\sim
N(0,\sigma^2_F)
\end{equation}
where  $\sigma^2_F$ is a process error expressing the year to year
variability in fishing mortality.

The indexed abundance model assumes that the biomass of YFT in the MHI
is approximately proportional to the biomass of an ``index''
population.
\begin{equation}
\log N_t - \log (Q\cdot I_t) = \omega_t;\quad \omega_t\sim N(0,\sigma^2_I)
\label{eqn:index}
\end{equation}
where
$I_t$ is the size of the index population at time $t$,
$Q$ is the estimated ratio of the MHI population size to the index
population,
and $\sigma^2_I$ is a process error representing the difference
between the MHI biomass and the abundance index. 

All process errors are assumed to have the same distribution
$N(0,\sigma^2_P)$; $\sigma_N$,$\sigma_F$, and $\sigma_I$ are assumed
to be equal and estimated as a global process error with variance
$\sigma^2_P$.

The logistic parameters $r$ and $K$ are notoriously difficult to estimate
accurately. Two different
alternative parameter substitutions were tested. In the first
alternative, MSY ($\MSY$) and fishing mortality at MSY ($\Fmsy$) were
estimated directly and substituted in \ref{eqn:intschaeferA} as
$r=2F_{\MSY}$ and $K=\frac{4\MSY}{r}$.
In the second alternative, the initial population size $B_1$ and a
proportionality constant $d$ are estimated directly and substituted in
\ref{eqn:intschaeferA} as $K=d\cdot B_1$.

Carruthers and McAllister (2011) recommend use of Bayesian priors for the
logistic growth parameter $r$ in equation~(\ref{eqn:ischaefer}). They
suggest $\tilde{r} = 0.486$ with a standard deviation of $\sigma_r = 0.046$
and coefficient of variation of ${\rm cv}=0.094$ for Atlantic YFT.
A lognormal prior on $r$ was implemented with 
$\tilde{r} = 0.486$ and $\sigma_r = 0.8$.
\begin{equation}
\log r - \log \tilde{r} = \rho ;\quad \rho\sim N(0,\sigma^2_r)
\end{equation}
which is a fairly ``loose'' constraint on the estimate of $r$.
$\rho$ becomes a component of the likelihood
(equation~\ref{eqn:likelihood}).

{\bf Observation Model, $O(\alpha)$.}
The general form of the observation model is
\begin{equation}
x_t = O(\alpha_t) + \varepsilon_t
\end{equation}
where the function $O$ describes the measurement process with
error $\varepsilon$ in observing the population.

Predicted catch, $\widehat{C}_{g,t}$, for each gear is the product of
estimated fishing mortality and the total biomass.
\begin{equation}
\widehat{C}_{g,t} = F_{g,t}\cdot\Bigl(\frac{N_{t-\Delta
t}+N_t}{2}\Bigr) \cdot e^{\varepsilon_t}
\label{eqn:obs1}
\end{equation}
where the total biomass is  the average
biomass over the time step (Quinn and Deriso, 1999), and
$\varepsilon_t$ is a ``zero-inflated'' log normal likelihood given by
\begin{equation}
  \log \varepsilon_t = \left\{
    \begin{array}{r@{\;:\quad}l}
       C_{g,t} > 0 &
(1-p_0)\cdot\bigg(\log\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2_Y}}
          -\Bigl(\frac{\log
C_{g,t}-\log\widehat{C}_{g,t}}{\sigma_Y}\Bigr)^2\bigg)\\
       C_{g,t} = 0 & p_0 \cdot\log \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2_Y}}\\
    \end{array}
  \right.
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_Y$ is the observation error and
$p_0$ is the proportion of observed catch observations equal to zero.
This proportion may be estimated or fixed at a constant value. For
current analysis, it is fixed at $p_0 = 0.15738$ as computed from the data.

{\bf Estimation.} The model states, $N_t$ and $F_{gt}$, are assumed to be random
effects (Skaug and Fournier, 2006). Model parameters are estimated by
maximizing the joint likelihood of the random
effects and the observations.
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:likelihood}
L(\theta,\alpha,x)=
\prod^m_{t=2}\big[\phi\big(\alpha_t-T(\alpha_{t-1}), \Sigma_\eta\big)\big]\cdot
\prod^m_{t=1}\big[\phi\big(x_t-O(\alpha_t),
\Sigma_\varepsilon\big)\big]\cdot\rho
\end{equation}
Here, $m$ is the number of time steps in the catch time series and
$\theta$ is a vector of model parameters (Table~\ref{tab:allvars1}).
The model is implemented in ADMB-RE (Fournier et al, 2012).
The actual number of
parameters to be estimated depends on the model configuration,
specified by phase flags in the input file.
