\begin{abstract}
Estimates of natural and fishing mortality from two different sources
were used to compute yield per recruit for yellowfin tuna fisheries in
the North Pacific Ocean. The results show that increasing the size at
first capture in the equatorial fisheries would increase the yield per
recruit by 30\%. The results for Hawaii-based fisheries are more
difficult to interpret. The available data suggest that increasing the
size at first capture would decrease the yield to the fishery.
\end{abstract}

\section*{Introduction}
The yield per recruit (YPR) is based on the theory of exploited fish
populations developed in the 1950s
by Beverton and Holt (1957). It is a relatively simple
approach requiring only estimates of fishing mortality (F), natural
mortality (M), and rate of individual growth in weight. YPR has fallen into
disuse because contemporary stock assessment methods provide more useful
biomass-based
information for fisheries managers. 
Nevertheless, YPR can provide insight and guidance regarding potential
fishery management interventions.
Estimates of age-dependent F and M are often available from
age-structured stock
assessments or tagging experiments. 

Estimates of F and M at age for Hawaiian yellowfin tuna are available
from two sources: 
the 2014 \MFCL\ (MFCL) stock assessment (Davies et al 2014).
and 
the 1995-2000 \HTTP\ (HTTP) (Itano and Holland, 2000; Adam et 2003) 
Here I
apply YPR analysis to evaluate potential effects of changing the
minimum size limit in the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) yellowfin tuna
fishery.

\section*{Estimates of Mortality and YPR}
\subsubsection*{MFCL}
The Hawaii Exclusive Economic Zone is split between regions 2 and 4
in the MFCL analysis (Figure~\ref{fig:mfclreg}). 
Region 4 extends from
10\deg{S} latitude to 20\deg{N} latitude and mainly comprises 
the large-scale equatorial purse seine and longline fisheries.
Region 2 extends from 20\deg{N} latitude to 50\deg{N} latitude
and comprises the Hawaii longline fishery and a variety of
small-vessel fisheries.
The boundary between these two regions passes through the MHI. 
The average annual yellowfin landings by the Hawaii longline fleet for
the period 2009 through 2012 was 186~mt, only around 29\% of the
628~mt landed by the combined Tuna Hand Line, Troll, Inshore Handline, and Aku
Boat fleets over the same period.
The yellowfin landings from these small boat fisheries in Hawaii are not
included in the data on which the MFCL assessment is based.

% "Average annual non-lonline catch: 627.88526718"
% "Average annual     lonline catch: 186.16933"

%Small boat fisheries catch in aggregate more yellowfin than the longline
%fishery (Figure~\ref{fig:fivegears})\help{or simple table}.

The 2014 MFCL yellowfin assessment includes data from 1952 through
2012. The stock is assumed to consist of 28 quarterly age classes. 
MFCL model output routinely includes estimates of mean weight at age,
natural mortality by age class, and fishing mortality by year, age
and region. 
The MFCL mortality estimates are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mfclmf}. 
The values of M used are the ``reference case'', i.e.,
specified values.
``Natural mortality at age was recalculated for previous assessments
using an approach applied to other tunas in the WCPO and EPO'' 
(Davies et al 2014).
For the purpose of YPR analysis, I average the fishing
mortality at age by region from 2009 through 2014 (the most recent 5
years or 20 quarters). 
Fishing mortality differs sharply between regions 4 and 2. In region
4, F is generally quite high at all sizes of fish with peaks near 5kg
and 30kg.
In region 2, F is an order of magnitude lower with no clear
modes. The lack of a mode in the smaller sizes is due to the omission
of data from non-longline fleets.

The YPR analysis for regions 4 and 2 are
presented in Figures~\ref{fig:r4ypr} and~\ref{fig:r2ypr} respectively.
In region 4, either increasing or decreasing the overall fishing
mortality would cause a decrease in yield per recruit.
Increasing the size at first capture to around 10 kg would increase the
yield from 1.5 kg/recruit to 2.0
kg/recruit, an increase of approximately 30\%.
In region~2 (Figure~\ref{fig:r2ypr}), the situation is quite different. 
Increasing or decreasing the total fishing morality increases
or decreases the yield, and
increasing the weight at first capture decreases the
the total yield.

\subsubsection*{HTTP}
Adam et al (2003) used a size- and spatially-structured
tag-attrition model to estimate
size-dependent fishing mortality, natural
mortality and migration rates between release and recapture sites from
HTTP yellowfin and bigeye tag recaptures. 
I used a simplified, spatially aggregated version of the same
model to estimate size-dependent fishing
mortality and natural mortality from the HTTP yellowfin recaptures.
Elimination of spatial strata allowd and increase in
the number of age groups in the simplified model
to eight from three used in Adam et al. (2003).

The HTTP mortality estimates are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:csmmf}.
These estimates differ from the MFCL estimates in several ways. The
size range is restricted because of the relatively few
recaptures of large fish. HTTP mortality estimates
are generally much higher than MFCL estimates.
The corresponding YPR analyses are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:yprcsm}.
The YPR in relation to current levels of fishing mortality suggests
that increasing F would produce modest gains in yield.
The YPR in relation to the weight at first capture suggests that
decreasing the size at first capture would decrease the
yield per recruit.


\section*{Discussion}
The MFCL stock assessment is intended to inform management of
large-scale purse seine and longline fisheries in the equatorial Pacific.
Application of MFCL stock assessment results to a relatively insular
small-scale fishery in the North Pacific may be stretching the
capabilities of MFCL. Division of the Hawaii EEZ between two regions
makes application to problems in Hawaii difficult. Furthermore,
exclusion from the analysis of the substantial catch of smaller fish exacerbates
the problem of applying the regional stock assessment to
resolve fishery management issues in Hawaii. The results in region 4
are instructive nevertheless.
Fishing mortality on yellowfin is higher for small-sized fish than for
larger fish, as is the suspected case in the MHI. By analogy, it is
possible that increasing the age at first capture in Hawaii could increase
the yield to the fishery. 

Fishing mortality on smaller-sized fish in MFCL region 2 is simulated
by adding a log-normal F-at-age component with a modal age class of 4
quarters to the estimated
F-at-age from MFCL. The simulated F-at-age is scaled so that the
ratio of its peak to the maximum F-at-age estimated by MFCL is in
proportion to the ratio of non-longline to longline landing in Hawaii
(dashed red line in Figure~\ref{fig:yprbogus}A). 
In this hypothetical situation, increasing the total
fishing effort by a factor of 5 would more than double the
yield, and increasing the weight at first capture would decrease the
yield, Figure~\ref{fig:yprbogus}B~and~C. 
The combined effects of increasing both the hypothetical fishing
mortality and size at first capture
in MFCL region 2 is shown in  Figure~\ref{fig:yprmultibogus}.
Benefits of increasing size at first capture are not apparent
until the increase in fishing mortality reaches 5-fold. 
If fishing mortality increases are restricted to
smaller sizes, benefits of increasing size a first capture are
undetectable at fishing mortality increases less than 10-fold.


The high mortality estimates from the HTTP tag recaptures are
troubling. To some extent, high mortality estimates reflect the
lack of precision in the definition of M. ``Natural mortality'' is not
a process that is ever observed in a way that can be easily tied to
specific parameters in a statistical model as fishing mortality is
tied to catch. 
For widely distributed, highly mobile fish such as tunas,
emigration is an important component of M in addition to the
biological processes usually associated with mortality, e.g. predation and
senescence. Both the MFCL stock assessment and the previous HTTP
analysis by Adam et al. (2003) account for movement, so the new
spatially aggregated mortality estimates include emigration and could
thus be biased higher.
Although the new estimates are difficult to compare directly to the
previous HTTP estimates because they use different size
classes, the new estimates are generally slightly higher or similar to
the previous estimates. 
The YPR analysis based on HTTP mortality estimates shows that
increasing the lower size limit on yellowfin could have a deleterious
effect on the fishery.

These results show clearly that current fishing mortality on yellowfin
tuna in Hawaii is low relative to natural mortality. As a result,
increasing the age at first capture would  cause harm to the fishery and
is unlikely to benefit the stock.
Yield per recruit analysis only provides information about the effects
of management actions on the yield to the fishery. YPR does not
provide insight into stock conditions and does not offer any guidance
in establishing biomass-based reference points. Therefore stock conservation
decisions should not be based solely on YPR analysis. Rather, such
decisions should be made on the basis of a biomass-based stock
assessment model that incorporates the salient features of tuna
population dynamics, namely rapid growth, high juvenile mortality,
and stock mixing with adjacent areas.

\section*{Conclusions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The YPR analysis for MFCL Region 4 shows that increasing
the size at first capture would increase the yield to the entire fishery.
Whether such a change in minimum size in Region~4 would
benefit the MHI yellowfin fishery is unknown.

\item The YPR analysis for MFCL Region 2 is inconclusive because only
longline catches from Region~2 are included in the assessment.

\item The YPR analysis using mortality estimates from tagging data is
also inconclusive because only small fish were returned and
available for the analysis. 

\item The WCPFC convention area stock assessment is unsuitable for
addressing management issues in Hawaii because the
MFCL regions are ill-addapted to Hawaii and the data do not include
all of the catch.

\item There is no clear benefit to the fishery of increasing the
minimum size restriction.
\end{enumerate}


\section*{Computing Yield Per Recruit}


Yield per recruit is an estimate of the contribution to the fishery of
a cohort during its entire life span.
Derivations of YPR often center around development of formulas for
calculating YPR based on assumptions of constant F and M over the life
of the exploited fish. Modern stock assessment methods produce
estimates of F and M by age making such assumptions unnecessary.
Sparre and Venema (1998) suggest an approach to computing YPR from age
specific data that is easily implemented in the R programming language
\url{http://www.r-project.org/}.

The biomass of fish of age $a$ is the product of the number of fish
of age $a$ in the population $(N_a)$ times the weight of age $a$ fish
$(W_a)$ i.e., $B_a=N_a\cdot W_a$, and the contribution of age $a$
fish to the yield is $Y_a=F_a\cdot B_a = F_a\cdot N_a\cdot W_a$, 
where $F_a$ is the fishing mortality at age.  
The yield per recruit is thus the $\sum_a Y_a/R$, where $R$ is the
recruitment at age $a=0$.
%The change in biomass with age is
%thus,\[ \frac{dB}{da} = N\frac{dW}{da}+W\frac{dN}{da} \].
%This expression can be approximated by finite differences as
%\[
%\frac{dB}{da} \approx
%\frac{B_a-B_{a-\Delta a}}{\Delta a} = 
%   N_{a-\Delta a}\frac{W_a-W_{a-\Delta a}}{\Delta a} + 
%   W_{a-\Delta a}\frac{N_a-N_{a-\Delta a}}{\Delta a}
%\].
%
Assuming that $R = 1 = N_0$, yield per recruit can be easily computed by these
relatively simple relations
\begin{eqnarray}
Z_a &=& M_a +F_a \\
N_a &=& N_{a-\Delta a}e^{-\Delta aZ_{a-\Delta a}}\\
Y_a &=& F_aN_aW_a\\
\frac{Y}{R} &=& \sum_a Y_a.
\end{eqnarray}
$F_a$ and $M_a$ are estimated by the MFCL assessment or the HTTP
tag attrition models.
$W_a$ can be computed from estimated or specified
growth parameters and length-weight relationships. In the case of the
MFCL assessment, $W_a$ is a routine model output. In the case of the
HTTP analysis, $W_a$ is computed by von Bertalanffy growth parameters
and the length-weight relationship from the MFCL assessment.
$\Delta a$ is set to 1 quarter.
