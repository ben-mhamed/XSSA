\section*{Introduction}
The yield per recruit (YPR) concept originates in work conducted in the 1950s
as described by Beverton and Hold (1957). It is a relatively simple
approach requiring estimates of fishing mortality (F), natural
mortality (M), rate of growth in weight. YPR seems to have fallen into
disuse because modern stock assessment methods provide more useful
information for fisheries managers. Furthermore most presentations of
YPR center around development of formulas for calculating YPR based on
assumptions of constant F and M over the life of the exploited fish.
Estimates of age-dependent F and M are often available from stock
assessments or tagging experiments. These estimates can be easily
applied to computing YPR with fewer assumptions. Sparre and Venema
(1998) suggest on approach.

Estimates of F and M at age for Hawaiian yellowfin tuna are avaialble
from two sources: the \HTTP\ (HTTP) and the 2014 \WCPFC\ (WCPFC) stock
assessment.

\section*{WCPFC}
The Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) are split between two regions 2 and 4
in the \MFCL\ (MFCL) analysis; Figure~\ref{fig:mfclreg}. The boundary between
these two regions passes through the MHI. Region 4 extends from
10\deg{S} latitude to 20\deg{N} latitude and comprises
the large-scale equatorial purse seine and longline fisheries and a
portion of the small boat fishery in the MHI. 
Region 2 extends from 20\deg{N} latitude to 50\deg{N} latitude
and comprises the Hawaii longline fishery 
and most of the small boat fisheries in the MHI.
These small boat fisheries catch in aggregate more yellowfin than the longline
fishery (Figure~\ref{fig:fivegears}), but are not included in the data
on which the MFCL assessment is based.

The 2014 MFCL yellowfin assessment includes data from 1952 through
2012. The stock is assumed to consist of 28 quarterly age classes. The
model output routinely includes estimate of natural mortality by age
class, mean weight at age, and fishing mortality by year, age and
region. For the purpose of YPR analysis, I average the natural
mortality at age for each region from 2009 through 2014 (the last 5
years or 20 quarters). 

The YPR analysis for regions 4 and 2 are
presented in Figures~\ref{fig:r4ypr} and~\ref{fig:r2ypr} repectively.
Each of this figures contains three panels. \label{pp:what}
The top panel is the estimated fishing mortality at age plotted
against mean weight at age. The red marks on the abscissa are placed at
the current lower catch weight limit and at three other
weight limits sometimes discussed; 
that is at 3, 10, 15, and 20 pounds.

The second panel show the change yield per recruit due to multiplying
the fishing mortality at all ages by constant factor ranging from 0 to
10, that is from essential closing all fisheries to expanding all
fisheries by a factor of 10. 
The dashed vertical red line is drawn at 1, the current fishing mortality.

The bottom panel shows the change in yield per recruit of increasing
the minimum size limit in the fishery from 0kg to 70kg. 
The dashed vertical red line is drawn at the weight producing the
highest yield per recruit.

In region 4, the purse seine and longline fisheries impose distinct fishing
mortality patterns on the yellowfin stock resulting in two peaks in
mortality, one near 5kg and another near 30kg.
It would appear that increasing or decreasing the overall fishing
mortality would cause a decrease in yield per recruit for all
fisheries.
\help{Or this may be an artifact of the math.}
Increasing the size at first capture to around 10 kg appear to by
about 25\% to all fisheries.

In region 2, the situation is quite different. Since the catches from
the small-boat fishery were excluded from the assessment, the fishing
mortality is imposed by the longline fishery alone. There are not
distinct peak.
Increasing or decreasing the total fishing morality simply increases
or decreases the yield.
Similarly, increasing the weight at first capture merely decreases the
yield.
